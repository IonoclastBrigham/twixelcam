# TwixelCam
A highly-pixelated camera app for sharing 140 pixels of abstract color

This is prototype code. Just a quick proof of concept. It does its core function: take a pixelated image which can be shared online. Currently, this basically means you push the shutter button, close the app, and then share from your favorite social app or gallery app.

## No Warranty

I make no claims this will work on anyone's phone but my own. Expect it to blow up from time to time. Or all the time. YMMV.
